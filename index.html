        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It structures content on the web and is composed of a series of elements that define 
            different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
        </p>
        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen, paper, or in other media. 
            It allows you to apply styles, such as fonts, colors, and spacing, to web pages.
